## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL GOES HERE>.


## Project Description

My game begins on page load and shows the player their cards as well as the dealers cards with 1 hidden.
The player decides if they want to hit or stand based on their card total
Then the game compares the sums of the dealer and the player and determines the winner
I chose to make Blackjack the casino game because I recently turned 21 and figured it was fitting. 

## Game Logic

```
XXX IMPORTANT! Replace all of this text with your own writing as you do these tasks/answer these questions THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

The writing should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

### MVP Criteria
- The game must function as a normal black jack game with a hit function and a stand function and be able to tell you who won
- The game must add the scores of the cards properly
- The game must end when either player or dealer busts

### Post-MVP Plans

- I want the player to be able to split their hand 
- I want to add betting and a bank so the game is more re-playable
- I want to add sound effects to my game and maybe dealing animations for the cards
