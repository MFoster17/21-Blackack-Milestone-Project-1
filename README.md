## Deployment

The web game is deployed at <YOUR DEPLOYED GITHUB.IO URL GOES HERE>.


## Project Description

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_

My game begins on page load and shows the player their cards as well as the dealers cards with 1 hidden.
The player decides if they want to hit or stand based on their card total
Then the game compares the sums of the dealer and the player and determines the winner
I chose to make Blackjack the casino game because I recently turned 21 and figured it was fitting. 

## Game Logic

```
XXX IMPORTANT! Replace all of this text with your own writing as you do these tasks/answer these questions THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

The writing should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

## Deliverables

>Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
>*Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!*

> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.


### MVP Criteria

XXX IMPORTANT! Replace the text below as you list the MVP criteria you met AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

- One thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.

### Post-MVP Plans

XXX IMPORTANT! Replace the text below as you list what you would do to improve the game post-MVP AND THEN DELETE THIS LINE XXX

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... *yet*. :)

I want the player to be able to split their hand 
I want to add betting 
I want to add sound effects to my game
